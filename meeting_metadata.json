Also, I'm a bit skeptical about the scalability of their product, as they are creating each and every picture in their synthetic dataset, and there is no GenAI involved. On one hand, it explains how they are able to do that even without robust agriculture datasets, on the other hand, it limits the scalability. \n\nYou can find the full meeting notes in this link.\nPowered by timeOS.ai",

Marunis technology is at a very early stage, so early that it is mainly theoretical and based on expired patents from 20 years ago (the patents were registered 20 years ago, but never commercialized). The founder has a strong background, but not in this specific domain. The predicted costs are high ($50K for one unit), and I assume it will be even higher. All of the above leads to the conclusion that if it will be applicable, and that is a strong if, it will require enormous amounts of resource both to develop and to install, and I only see governmental agncies spending this amount of money for anti-GPS jamming solutions (commercial flights, airforce flights, etc).   \n\nYou can find the full meeting notes in this link.\nPowered by timeOS.ai",
